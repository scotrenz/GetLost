Hiking app that allows user to find/save top rated trails, check weather, and track lifetime stats.

Stack: HTML, CSS, Javacript, JQuery, Firebase.

The app uses google maps API with the users location or search location along with desired distance away to show top rated trails via REI's hiking project API. The Weather Underground API is then used to show local weather at the trailhead. User can then favorite trails for later and recorded if they hiked a trail. Lifetime stats are save to the user's profile in Firebase and displayed the the bottom.
